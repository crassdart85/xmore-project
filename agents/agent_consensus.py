Consensus Agent — Weighted Voting Across All Agents

Combines predictions from all individual agents into a single consensus signal
based on each agent's historical accuracy. Agents with higher accuracy get
more voting power.

The consensus signal is stored as a separate "Consensus" prediction in the
database, providing investors with a single unified view.
